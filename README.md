# CaptionFlow
SmartSight is an advanced image captioning system built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. It processes an input image and generates context-aware, natural language descriptions using deep learning. Ideal for accessibility tools, media tagging, and AI-driven image understanding.
